Hi,

So picking up from where I left off I finished implementing the light switch. This was a really cool lesson as it taught me how to connect one Gameobject with another and creating a trigger event when you come into contact with an object that then effects another object is something I can do a lot with, the potential is limitless and it's given me another tool I can use when designing levels. From here I continued on with the lessons and learned how to trigger multiple elements at once. To do this I was taught about IEnumerators which essentially serve as a sequence of events which you can then call in a conditional and it will execute each event contained in order. Once implemented it was really exiting to see because now once the switch is pressed the door now moved down (this was done using LeanTween which is an add on which makes it easier to animate objects) and triggers a dust particle effect. It's really starting to take shape. 

Max :)
