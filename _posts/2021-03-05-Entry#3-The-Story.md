Hi,

So today I started to think more about the story and where I could possibly take it. I started by doing some research into comas and what people's experience have been when in one for a prolonged amount of time. I found an interesting paper which told the story of a woman who was in a prolonged coma and told stories of seeing people she knew from her life but not recognizing them as that person, rather they were a stranger. I thought this was fascinating and lined up well with how I wanted to tell the story of the game, through these towns members representing people from the boys life. After this I decided to develop some of the characters, I developed and wrote a bit about who would be the main characters of the game. I have a clear direction of what I want to do with the story, the characters involved and the subtext I want to add so the next step in terms of the narrative would be to write a script.

Max :)
