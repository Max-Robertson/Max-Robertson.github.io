Hi,

In a continuation from yesterdays lesson I learned how to make use of a particle effect. Basically I used a particle effect that came with the asset package which was like a puff of smoke that would indicate a collision with a wall or a "you cant go here" type event. This was an interesting lesson as im learning how to create methods which trigger on an event, this is a template which I could learn and use to create lots of different results. I created the particle collision then began working on another trigger event, this time when the player object collides with the switch object it would turn a light on. I got half way through but will continue with the lesson and expand and what I learned from it next time. 

Max :)
