Hi :p ,

Now that I had everything to set up and learned the very basics I continued doing this section. Today I covered: Arrays, Lists, Enum and Variable Attributes. Ive also started keeping a log book where I make notes on my understanding of the course and add notes for future reference etc. 

Max :)
