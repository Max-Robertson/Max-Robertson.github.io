Hi,

I'm back working on the course after taking a break for my brother coming home. I'm not starting a section of the course called "Unity Game Development Essentials" from what I can tell this section looks like it's covering more coding but specific to Game Development, it looks more hands on and will give me an idea of how to create and develop my own games from scratch. The lessons today covered setting up the scene. This sounded pretty simple in concept but moving pre made assets and setting up a scene (floors and walls etc) was more difficult than what I'd done in Unity before. I have very briefly looked into making 2D games in Unity to have designed scenes using tilemaps etc which is a lot easier than anything in the third dimension as adding that extra Z axis made it tricky initially to align objects such as floor boards and make sure everything looks like I would expect it to if I was a player. A lot of it was getting used to Unity editor itself jogging my memory on the earlier lessons and it started to feel more and more natural. So today was spent doing the first half of the scene set up.

Max :)
