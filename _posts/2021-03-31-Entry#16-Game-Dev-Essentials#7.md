Hi,

I kicked off today by learning how to add audio clips into the game. I learned how to set up an audio clip so that it plays on a conditional, got taught how to access an audio clip from both the current object and another gameObject. This allowed me to add another dimension to the game and again is exiting as what was just a scene is now looking more and more like a level. Continuing on I learned how to spawn an object, here I was taught how I can use things like sockets to create an exact point for the object to be spawned from another object. I then coded the object spawn code which meant my player object could now fire out bullet type objects. I was shown how assign the instantiation (creation) of an object to a variable which was useful for 1) ensuring each object that was created would have the same name which could be referenced 2) It means that the object can be accessed and assigned properties after its creation (which was used to make the object a random size each time and add force to it once created). The final step in the projectile set of lessons was making a pressure pad which would appear behind the door that opened that could be destroyed by these projectiles. I did this lesson and coded it so that the door had hit points and once the bullets collided with the pressure pad it would lose a hit point, on the event of losing all hitpoints the object will be destroyed. Now that this has been implemented the level almost is a sort of minigame, a sense of purpose has been created and gives the player something to do. As well as this having an object be destroyed after a set number of collisions is another skill that can be used to created many things such as destructible environment objects such as crates to enemies. Again this is exiting as I can feel my skill set growing an am starting to think of things I can do independently of the tutorial videos.

Max :)
