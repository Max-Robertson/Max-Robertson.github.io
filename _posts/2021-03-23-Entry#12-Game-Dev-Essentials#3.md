Hi,

Today I again continued the Unity Game Development Essentials section of the course, the course today discussed the Unity Scripting API Documentation and how it can be used to find solutions to problems you have when developing a game using the Unity Engine.The course recommended reading over the documentation for the input class to familiarize myself with all the possible uses for the class. I took todays time to do just that, I read over the documentation for "input" and "transform" and familiarized myself with the scripting API documentation so I knew how to use it in the future should I need to find a solution to a problem I have. After doing this I implemented the rotate functionality to the gameobject covered in the next lessons and continued to dicument the lessons like I've been doing.

Max :)
