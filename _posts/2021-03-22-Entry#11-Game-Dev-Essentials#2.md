Hi,

Continuing directly from yesterdays lessons I wanted to finish the scene set up, Now I was more familiar again with how it works it was a lot easier to finish. I followed the tutorials for the most part then started free styling when I got to the set dressing, I really enjoyed this part as I felt I could stretch my creative muscles. After finishing setting up a scene that I could use as an environment to learn some more c# code, I started learning code. I learned how to create an object and make that object move left, forwards, backwards and right with the W,A,S,D keys. Obviously a fundamental part of game development so was great to learn. 

Max :)
