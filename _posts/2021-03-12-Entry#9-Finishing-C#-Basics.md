Hi :p ,

Today I did the final stretch of the "Learning C# With Unity Section" the final areas covered were: Loops (Basics, Nested, While), Random Class, For each and Methods (Parameters, Return Value and Overloading). I enjoyed this section of the course. I feel like I learned a lot and have been shown real life cases through out the lesson of how this code could be used in a Game Dev context. Although Im very early into the process I can feel my confidence level begin to grow with C# and I look forward to continuing the course after a little break.

Max :)
