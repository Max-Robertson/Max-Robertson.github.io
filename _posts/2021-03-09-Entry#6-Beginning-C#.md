Hi,

Now thats I have done the basics of Unity it's time to move onto the next section "Learn C# with Unity" This covers the basics of the C# sharp language fundamentals and how you would use the language within Unity. Today I did the first part of this section which covered setting up the IDE, linking with Unity etc as well as the basics of syntax and variable definition.

Max :)
