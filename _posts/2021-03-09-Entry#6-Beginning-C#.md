Hi :p ,

Now that I have established what it is I want to make, I wanted to think about what I would have to do to achieve this. Break down my goals into their smallest steps so that they are manageable tasks that can be completed in reasonable amount of time. I split each of the tasks into 4 categories: Planning, Production, Pre-Production, Testing. I then added all the tasks I could think of in these categorized, and adding sub-tasks if the task itself could be broken down further. Finally I colour coded them based on progress I had made so far (Red: not started, Amber: In progress, Green: Completed). Now the board is complete it gives me an outline and goals I can tick off day by day in order to achieve my goals.

Max :)
