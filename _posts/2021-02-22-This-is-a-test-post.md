Hi :p ,

This is the first entry in what is going to be a series of "Dev Diary" entries. Before I started
making them I first wanted to clarify what my goals were. I am a Cyber Security Graduate who currently works in the tech industry and have for the last two years since I graduated. I enjoyed my first Job for a while but ultimately I knew I wasn't fulfilled, the job was lacking for me in one department. I wasn't passionate about what I was doing. Theres a satisfaction that comes from doing your job well and making the most out of the opportunity you have but it just isn't the same as working on something you're passionate about, with likeminded people. Thats what I wanted so thats what I'm going to do. I've been passionate about creativity since I can remember, from writing film scripts to drafting Tv show ideas. Im happiest when I am creating something. I am also passionate about video games, and playing them for the last 20 years seeing how much they have grown in so many ways including a massive potential to be a new, groundbreaking story telling medium that can now deliver the cinematic experience offered by films while having the interactive element of storytelling that is a staple of video games. I think thats so exiting and I want to be a part of that. So realistically what can I do to achieve that ? I dont have a degree in Game Design or Game Development. However I do have Computer Science degree, and two years of industry expereince. I think that makes for a pretty good foundation, I just need to expand my skillset to cover the skills I'm missing. So thats where this Dev Diary comes in. My plan is to Plan, Write, Design, Code and Prototype a 2D Game in Unity. I will do this by taking Online Classes (Udemy etc) teaching me the skiils I need to learn for this role and as I learn them apple them to the Design and Developement of the game. I hope as I progress through this project to develop the neccesary skills to be considered for a Game Design or Developer role (something which I currently am not). So I will be posting regular updates on this blog to track my progress and and skill development. Looking forward to it.

Max :)
