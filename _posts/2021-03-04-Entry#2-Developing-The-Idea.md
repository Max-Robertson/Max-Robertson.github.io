Hi,

Now that the idea for the game has been established I wanted to think about what this would actually look like as a game. This is what I came up with:

Wake up in a room, no idea where you are what you are doing there.by the end you need to obtain a checklist. Of random items. These are the items you need to finish the game. Can get the “true ending” by finding them all.   

The core of the gameplay is made up from the town. This will be the hub of the game and will house all of the characters in the game. This town will almost serve as a daily life sim (ala Animal Crossing) with interactions, daily chores, shops, etc. Like mentioned the you wake up in town on the same day, so naturally you’ll be repeating the same thing over and over but the draw will come from the possibility for randomness in that ‘same’ day (ala Hades) each day presents the possibility for a random event to trigger, at the end of each you are given a spin or some form of random item that has rarity etc (town garb and battle garb are different), random chances to earn coins , find parts etc one of the main random events that can trigger are quest events, maybe you need to fulfill a certain condition to trigger some etc but these quest events will allow you to learn more about this character, it will trigger their storyline and they will request something from you, quests will be accessible from a certain room in the game. These quests are where the battle gameplay comes in, these will be rooms which you have to navigate in search of something or an objective the enemies will appear and you will fight them using turn based combat. This turn based combat will have also an element of randomization to it as well, each enemy will have the possibility of a core attack where you just select attack/ slash whatever it may be but also each enemy will have a random attack each e.g. brain enemies would have a multiple choice trivia question, a speed demon would have a QTE etc.


Max :)
