Hi,

So going into this project I had some ideas that had been floating around my head for a while, I now need to choose one and start fleshing it out so I could Design and Develop a game around it. I spent the start of the day going through some of my many Iphone Notepad files, Google docs etc where I jot down some of my ideas. I settled on an idea and fleshed it out this is what I have:  

You wake up in a small American mountain town. No idea who you are or how you got there. You’re given no objective and like the character don’t know who you are why you are here. You’re allowed to freely roam this mysterious town, asking the various townsfolk what it is you’re doing here. When you reach the towns exit a broken-down car lies there and a weird ominous beeping can be heard. A message “you’re in no position to leave yet” is displayed to the player and you head back. Once you reach the end of your day, you find a checklist with a list of random items on it. you then pass out and wake up at the start of the same day. It seems to be a time loop (like Groundhog Day etc etc etc) you still have your inventory from the day before but everything else is reset. This town is full of characters and stories, each day allows you to interact with one of these characters you will learn different thing about them each day and random events will trigger unlocking different characters story mission, which will unlock one of the items on the checklist. When you get to the end of the game you pack up your items, repair the car with some and head on your way. As you drive away the beeping gets louder and faster until it’s revealed to be a heartbeat monitor. You had been in a coma after an intentional overdose, the characters in the town are people from your life, the characters are exaggerated features of what they mean to this character in real life. The Story of the character you play as is told through each and every interaction you have with the Townspeople. The more you choose to engage with them, the game and optional content the more you ultimately learn about our mystery character and who he is.

Working title will be: "A Day in the life"

I will continue to develop the story and start to think about Gameplay tomorrow.

Max :)
