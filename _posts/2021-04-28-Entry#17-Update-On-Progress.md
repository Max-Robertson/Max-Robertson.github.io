Hi,

Covered since the last update on my unity course: Setting up different camera states and having them be changeable via key press, Setting up a minimap, Setting up player gravity. Again all of these were useful to learn as it's something that is widely used in game dev. I feel like the coding aspect of the course is becoming more and more automatic instead of me constantly having to refer to the lesson. That being said some variable definitions or methods are skimmed over and without a full explanation being given, usually this is paired with "you dont need to know what this is right now" but Im keeping a track of what I understand and dont in my log book to keep track just in case as I want to avoid a situation where im expected to know something within the course and I dont.

So things have been a little hard to work on lately as I am in the process of a big move, I've been back and forth to the place im moving settling in things there and so havent had my computer to work on my unity course. I've been still trying to actively engage in the game design / dev world and learn what I can. I discovered a conference called GDC (Game Design conference) which host some talented creatives to talk through their process or specific ideas. It kind of reminds me of ted talk but for game design. I found a couple interesting ones I thought I'd mention:

Reinventing God of War by Cory Barlog:

Uncharted 2: Creating an Active Cinematic Experience by Neil Druckmann and Bruce Straley:

I also started watching a documentary series with Ken Levine and Shawn Robertson, each episode was a 20 minute segment on a specific part of the making of bioshock which covered areas like the creative process and pitching the game. These episodes were unlocked by finding collectibles in the remastered version of the game which I thought was an awesome idea. Im just over half way through them atm.

Obviously these videos weren't as hands on as the game dev/ design course Ive been doing but I still learned a lot from these professionals talking about their creative process and what they prioritize when designing a game and thinking about the player experience. In many cases it was astonishing to see just how much of my play style had not only been accounted for in the game design but prioritized. Absolutely loved watching these and will continue to learn from these sources.

Max :)
