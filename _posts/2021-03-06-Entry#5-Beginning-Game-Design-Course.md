Hi :p ,

So one of the main objectives of this course, and on a larger scale this project, was to learn how to efficiently code using the C# langauge. This Section of the course entitled "Learn C# With Unity" will teach me the fundamentals of the language. I started about by doing the first set of lessons from it, this included setting up the IDE linking it to unity etc before finally learning the basic syntax of the language as well as how to define variables. I have started taking notes and am keeping a log book for this section of the course to ensure I am understanding what I am learning. I will continue this course tomorrow.

Max :)
