Hi :p ,

Now that I have established what I want to achieve and how I'm going to achieve it, I need to learn the fundamental skills required to achieve these goals. I have decided to take an Online Udemy course which covers a lot of the areas I desire to learn about. The course i'm doing is called "
Become a Game Designer the Complete Series Coding to Design", it's 84 hours worth of lessons and covers everything from getting to grips with Unity, to learning the fundamentals of the C# language and also covers non code aspects such as 2d and 3d level design and character making. This will be what I'll be posting about for the next couple months at least. I believe doing this course and perhaps some others will support my goals and make achieving them a realistic goal. I started by doing the "Getting Started With Unity" section was reasonable short and was familiarizing me with the unity workspace. I learned how to use the Unity software, navigate through projects, scenes etc and how to utilize the asset store to get started. I will continue this course after a break tomorrow.

Max :)
