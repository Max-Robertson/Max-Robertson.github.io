Hi,

Today I continued learning the fundamentals of the C# language. Covered in Todays lessons were: Arithmetic, if else (if else if etc), conditional ternary / multi conditional and switch case. A lot of the first lessons I was more or less familiar with through using other programming languages and in the past I would have skipped over them but if I'm learning a new language I want to do it right, and that means going over the very basics because although I may be familiar with how an "if" statement works every language is different and I could overlook a detail which causes my code to be inefficient or error prone in the future. I am now getting to lessons which are either new concepts or I haven't learned about them since early in university so re learning them is essential. Im enjoying the lessons and continuing to make detailed notes to ensure I am understanding it all.

Max :)
