Hi,

Continuing with the Game Dev Essentials Section Todays lessons covered:  

:- Redoing Rotate so it makes more sense to the average player

:- Learning about collision events / Rigid Bodies and how they work in Unity

:- Scaling a Game Object with input  

:- Changing the Color of an Object with input

:- Learn what particle effects are  

Again I feel like i'm learning a lot and all of what I'm learning seems incredibly useful for what I'm wanting to do with this project.

Max :)
